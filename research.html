    My research in blazar microvariability is conducted under Dr. James R. Webb as part of the FIU Blazar Group. Links to both
    Dr. Webb's homepage and the webpage of the FIU Blazar Group are included at the bottom. While my work is theoretical, observations
    are conducted by the research group (which I take part in) in order to test different aspects of my work. These observations are 
    conducted through the use of four main optical telescopes in collaboration with the Southeastern Association for Research in 
    Astronomy: a 0.9m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, the SARA 
    North telescope; a 1.0m telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands, the SARA East telescope;
    a 0.6m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the SARA South telescope; and our own 24in telescope at
    the observatory at FIU, the Stocker telescope.
