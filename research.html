    My research in blazar microvariability is conducted under Dr. James R. Webb as part of the FIU Blazar Group. Links to both
    Dr. Webb's homepage and the webpage of the FIU Blazar Group are included below. While my work is theoretical, observations
    are conducted by the research group (which I take part in) in order to test different aspects of my work. These observations are 
    conducted through the use of four main optical telescopes in collaboration with the Southeastern Association for Research in 
    Astronomy: a 0.9m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, the SARA 
    North telescope; a 1.0m telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands, the SARA East telescope;
    a 0.6m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the SARA South telescope; and our own 24in telescope at
    the observatory at FIU, the Stocker telescope.

    What is a blazar?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A blazar is a subtype of galaxies known as quasars. Quasars are very interesting galaxies to study for two main reasons:
    they are very far away from us, and thus are extremely old (billions of years old), and they are <i>very</i> bright, often times
    tens or hundreds of thousands of times brighter than an average galaxy (such as our own). There is something very peculiar about
    the light emitted by quasars, though. The brightness from a typical galaxy comes from the added brightness of all the stars
    contained by the galaxy, and so the brightness is spread throughout the galaxy. The brightness from quasars, though, originates
    not from throughout the galaxy, but from a tiny point at the center, known as the nucleus. Because of this, when quasars were 
    discovered, they were called "quasi-stellar objects" -- they seemed to be stars, because they were so small, but they were 
    unimaginably brighter than stars ever get to be. We now know that quasars are so bright because they have a rapidly rotating,
    supermassive black hole at their center, which powers something known as a relativistic jet. This jet, which leaves the nucleus
    of the galaxy in a roughly straight line, emits the brightness that we see. How do blazars fit into all of this? A blazar is
    simply a quasar with its jet pointed directly at us.
