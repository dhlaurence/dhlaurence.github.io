  <br>
  
  <p>For this course, you will be <b>required to buy two items</b>: 
    
    <br>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Textbook: <b>Physics for Engineers and Scientists, 3rd ed., Hans C. Ohanian, ISBN: 9780393929799</b></li>
      <li>A scientific calculator, NOT a graphing calculator or any type of programmable calculator, which will NOT be allowed on 
        exams</li>
    </ul>
    
    We will meet for lecture twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays from noon to 1:50PM. If you've never taken a physics class before, you should read my note on how to succeed in a physics class
    <a href="http://www.blazartheory.com/other/underconstruction.html">here</a>. During the semester, <b>we will cover the 
    following topics</b>:
    
    <br>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematics review</li>
      <li>Kinematics</li>
      <li>Newton's Laws</li>
      <li>Energy Conservation</li>
      <li>Momentum Conservation</li>
      <li>Rotational Motion and Gravity</li>
      <li>Applications: Simple harmonic motion, waves, and fluids</li>
      <li>Thermodynamics</li>
    </ul>
    
    If you have a question that you need answered, but don't have tine to meet me in my office during office hours, email me at 
    <b>TBA</b>; make sure you <b>include the class you're in with the section number</b>, e.g. PHY2048 584761, so that I know 
    what class you're in. I'm teaching seven courses this semester, so I might not be able to remember which class you're in off
    the top of my head.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Your grade in the course will be based on your performance on the homework assignments, the 3 exams, and the cumulative final
    exam. See the grading scheme below. The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response problems, with 10
    multiple choice questions worth 2 points each (total of 20 points) and 4 free response problems worth 20 points each (total of 80
    points). <b>There will actually be FIVE available free response problems, of which you only need to answer FOUR; you CANNOT do
    the fifth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to break down like:
    
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>Exam 1: 2 - 6</li>
      <li>Exam 2: 7, 8,1 0 - 13</li>
      <li>Exam 3: 9, 14 - 18</li>
      <li>Final: 2 - 21</li>
    </ul>
    
    Even though you won't be tested on it directly, you <b>should read chapter 1</b>, as an introduction to the study of physics. We're
    going to approach the material in a way slightly out of order with respect to the textbook. For instance, we're going to begin
    with a mathematics review, which includes chapter 3 (and other math not reviewed in the textbook), so that's where we'll begin;
    chapter 9, gravitation, is best studied <b>after</b> we cover rotational motion, so we'll discuss it after we finish chapter
    13, which is why it appears on exam 3 and not exam 2. As a final comment, we won't be covering thermodynamics -- chapters 19, 20,
    and 21 -- on any of the exams, but they <b>will</b> be on the cumulative final exam. For a detailed itinerary of the semester, see
    the Course Schedule below. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <b>You can compute your grade in the class</b> with the following formula (were HW is your grade on the homework, LG is the lowest-graded
    exam, MG is the mid-graded exam, HG is the highest-graded exam, and FE is the final exam):
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <center>Grade = (%HW*15) + (%LG*10) + (%MG*20) + (%HG*25) + (%FE*30)</center>
    
    <br>
    
    For example, if you get a 94% on the homework, a 75% on exam 1, a 92% on exam 2, an 85% on exam 3, and an 83% on the final exam,
    your grade in the course will be: (0.94*15) + (0.75*10) + (0.85*20) + (0.92*25) + (0.83*30) = 86.5, which is a B (refer to the 
    grading scale given below). For final grades, <b>I round to the first decimal place</b>; for instance, an 86.92 = 86.9, which 
    is a B, but an 86.96 = 87.0, which is a B+.
