  <p>Welcome to the companion website for Physics I with Calculus! This is the webiste for the course with the description above,
    so make sure this is actually your class before continuing. Hopefully you'll find physics interesting, and I can impart on
    you some knowledge and wisdom about the world you see around you and interact with, physically, every day, whether or not you
    realize it. Below is an abridged version on the <b>syllabus handed out in class</b>, which can also be found 
    <a href="http://www.blazartheory.com/other/underconstruction.html>here</a>. 
    
  <center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>
    
  <br>
      
  For this course, you will be <b>required to buy two items</b>: 
    
  <br>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Textbook: <b>Physics for Engineers and Scientists, 3rd ed., Hans C. Ohanian, ISBN: 9780393929799</b></li>
    <li>A scientific calculator, NOT a graphing calculator or any type of programmable calculator, which will NOT be allowed on 
      exams</li>
  </ul>
    
  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to <b>record audio of the lectures</b> to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center><b>Reviews and Review Material</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  Throughout the course, 
  
  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>
  
  <br>
    
  We will meet for lecture twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays from noon to 1:50PM. If you've never taken a physics class before, you should read my note on how to succeed in a physics class
  <a href="http://www.blazartheory.com/other/underconstruction.html">here</a>. During the semester, <b>we will cover the 
  following topics</b>:
    
  <br>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Mathematics review</li>
    <li>Kinematics</li>
    <li>Newton's Laws</li>
    <li>Energy Conservation</li>
    <li>Momentum Conservation</li>
    <li>Rotational Motion and Gravity</li>
    <li>Applications: Simple harmonic motion, waves, and fluids</li>
    <li>Thermodynamics</li>
  </ul>
    
  If you have a question that you need answered, but don't have tine to meet me in my office during office hours, email me at 
  <b>TBA</b>; make sure you <b>include the class you're in with the section number</b>, e.g. PHY2048 584761, so that I know 
  what class you're in. I'm teaching seven courses this semester, so I might not be able to remember which class you're in off
  the top of my head.
   
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  Your grade in the course will be based on your performance on the homework assignments, the 3 exams, and the cumulative final
  exam. See the grading scheme below. The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response problems, with 10
  multiple choice questions worth 2 points each (total of 20 points) and 4 free response problems worth 20 points each (total of 80
  points). <b>There will actually be FIVE available free response problems, of which you only need to answer FOUR; you CANNOT do
  the fifth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to break down like:
    
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Exam 1: 2 - 6</li>
    <li>Exam 2: 7, 8,1 0 - 13</li>
    <li>Exam 3: 9, 14 - 18</li>
    <li>Final: 2 - 21</li>
  </ul>
    
  Even though you won't be tested on it directly, you <b>should read chapter 1</b>, as an introduction to the study of physics. We're
  going to approach the material in a way slightly out of order with respect to the textbook. For instance, we're going to begin
  with a mathematics review, which includes chapter 3 (and other math not reviewed in the textbook), so that's where we'll begin;
  chapter 9, gravitation, is best studied <b>after</b> we cover rotational motion, so we'll discuss it after we finish chapter
  13, which is why it appears on exam 3 and not exam 2. As a final comment, we won't be covering thermodynamics -- chapters 19, 20,
  and 21 -- on any of the exams, but they <b>will</b> be on the cumulative final exam. For a detailed itinerary of the semester, see
  the Course Schedule below. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Grade Calculation:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  <b>You can compute your grade in the class</b> with the following formula (were HW is your grade on the homework, LG is the lowest-graded
  exam, MG is the mid-graded exam, HG is the highest-graded exam, and FE is the final exam):
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center>Grade = (%HW*15) + (%LG*10) + (%MG*20) + (%HG*25) + (%FE*30)</center>
    
  <br>
   
  For example, if you get a 94% on the homework, a 75% on exam 1, a 92% on exam 2, an 85% on exam 3, and an 83% on the final exam,
  your grade in the course will be: (0.94*15) + (0.75*10) + (0.85*20) + (0.92*25) + (0.83*30) = 86.5, which is a B (refer to the 
  grading scale given below). For final grades, <b>I round to the first decimal place</b>; for instance, an 86.92 = 86.9, which 
  is a B, but an 86.96 = 87.0, which is a B+.
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center><b>Class Policies:</b></center>
    
  <br>
    
  Notice that there is no attendance factored into the grade. This is because <b>I don't take attendence</b>; if you want to learn
  the material, you'll show up to lecture, but ultimately you're and adult in college and it's up to you to make your own decisions.
  I also have no policies on coming to class late (if you're not disruptive, I would <i>rather</i> you came late than not at all), 
  leaving class early, eating in class, texting, etc. As long as you're not disruptive or disrespectful to your fellow classmates, 
  I don't care how you spend your time in class, though I'd recommend participating in lecture. <b>I do have a policy on tardiness 
  for exams</b>, though; you are expected to be on time (up to 10 minutes late) for an exam. If you're any later, it gives you an 
  unfair advantage over other students if you spent that extra time studying. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Something that is very important is <b>academic honesty</b>. You are expected to turn in original work with every assignment and
  exam (that is, no cheating). Academic dishonesty of any form will <b>NOT</b> be tolerated.
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  My policy on <b>extra credit</b> is this: if the class, on a whole, is doing below what is expecteed, then I will assign extra
  credit to everyone; I'm not a big fan of curving grades, but I have no issues with everyone doing extra credit and <i>earning</i>
  that boost in grade. However, that being said, if one student is underachieving, I cannot assign extra credit to that one student
  alone. I may assign random, small bits of extra credit throughout the course (e.g. a special problem I want you solve as extra 
  credit homework), <b>but there is no guarantee of extra credit in this course</b>, so if you ask for it, don't expect a guaranteed
  "yes" from me as a response.
