  <p>This course will cover the contents in the following chapters of the textbook:

    <ul>
      <li>Ch 1: The Night Sky</li>
      <li>Ch 2: Light and Telescopes</li>
      <li>Ch 3: The Solar System</li>
      <li>Ch 4: Earth and its Moons</li>
      <li>Ch 5: The Eight Planets</li>
      <li>Ch 8: The Sun</li>
      <li>Ch 9: Measuring the Stars</li>

      <li>Ch 14: Galaxies</li>
      <li>Ch 15: Cosmology and the Universe</li>
  </ul>

  We will have a short quiz (2 problems) <b>at the start of all Tuesday lectures</b>, reviewing the material covered in the
  previous week. These quizzes won't involve any calculations and will be on broad topics within the chapter.
  These quizzes will be handed out an collected within the <b>first 10 minutes of class</b>. If you are running late, but still
  attend the majority of lecture, the professor maintains the ability to allow you to take the quiz immediately following
  class, but <b>this allowance is not guaranteed</b>; if you don't show up until the very end of class and ask to be allowed
  to take the quiz without an excused absence as defined in the Student Handbook, the professor reserves the right to refuse.</p>

  <p>In addition to the weekly quizzes, there will be <b>two projects</b> assigned during the semester. The topics of these
  projects will be discussed when they are assigned, the first to be assigned (roughly) one-quarter of the way through the
  semester, and the second to be assigned (roughly) three-quarters of the way through the semester. These projects are to be
  <b>completed individually</b>; any copying/plagarizing/etc. will be an instance of Academic Misconduct as outlined in the
  Student Handbook and will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>Finally, there will be two exams administered during the class: a mid-term and a non-cumulative final exam (<b>dates
    TBA</b>). Each exam will be multiple choice, focusing mainly on conceptual and historical questions, but may have a few
    computational questions, so <b>make sure to bring a scientific calculator</b> to each exam. Do not bring a graphing or
    programmable calculator. The professor will not have extra calculators on exam day, so please make sure to bring one
    with you.</p>
