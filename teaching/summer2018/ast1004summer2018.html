  <p><center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>
    
  <br>
      
  For this course, you will be <b>required to buy two items</b>: 
    
  <br>
    
  <ul>
    <li><b>Textbook</b>: Astronomy Today, Volume 2: Stars and Galaxies, 9th ed., Chaisson & McMillan.</li>
    <li><b>Materials</b>: Scantron sheets for the two exams, the midterm and the final. Must be long enough to answer 30 
      questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to record audio of the lectures to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>
  
  <br>
    
  During the semester, <b>we will cover the following topics</b>:
    
  <br>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Introduction to Astronomy</li>
    <li>Stars</li>
    <li>Galaxies</li>
    <li>Cosmology & the Evolution of the Universe</li>
  </ul>
   
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>
  
  <br>

  For each exam, except for the final, you will have the <b>first 1 hour and 15 minutes of class</b> to take the exam.
  There will be a 5 minute break after the exam. The <b>roughly 50 minutes remaining will be used to cover new material</b>.
  Because the summer semester is short, we have to be economic with our time. 

  <br>
  <br>

  The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response 
  problems, with 10 multiple choice questions worth 2.5 points each (total of 25 points) and 3 free response problems worth 
  25 points each (total of 75 points). <b>There will actually be FOUR available free response problems, of which you only 
  need to answer THREE; you CANNOT do the fourth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to 
  break down like:
    
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Exam 1: Ch.'s 22 - 28</li>
    <li>Exam 2: Ch.'s 29 - 31 and 33 - 34</li>
    <li>Exam 3: Ch.'s 36 - 41 (depending on material covered in Ch.'s 37 - 40) </li>
    <li>Final: All material covered on previous exams.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> 
    <center>Grading Scheme:</center>

  <p><center>I use a sliding grading scheme, with exam grades dependent on how well you do.</center></cp>

    <td>Homework</td>

  <center><b>Grade Calculation:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  <b>You can compute your grade in the class</b> with the following formula (were HW is your grade on the homework, LG is the lowest-graded
  exam, MG is the mid-graded exam, HG is the highest-graded exam, and FE is the final exam):
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center>Grade = (%HW*15) + (%LG*10) + (%MG*20) + (%HG*25) + (%FE*30)</center>
    
  <br>
   
  For example, if you get a 94% on the homework, a 75% on exam 1, a 92% on exam 2, an 85% on exam 3, and an 83% on the final exam,
  your grade in the course will be: (0.94*15) + (0.75*10) + (0.85*20) + (0.92*25) + (0.83*30) = 86.5, which is a B (refer to the 
  grading scale given below). For final grades, <b>I round to the first decimal place</b>; for instance, an 86.92 = 86.9, which 
  is a B, but an 86.96 = 87.0, which is a B+.
