  <p><center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>
    
  <br>
      
  For this course, you will be <b>required to buy two items</b>: 
    
  <br>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Textbook: <b>Physics for Engineers and Scientists, 3rd ed., Hans C. Ohanian</b> (either Volume 2 <b>and</b> 3, or 
      the full textbook). <b>MasteringPhysics will not be used</b> in this class, so you don't need to purchase a copy of 
      the book that provides the code or buy an individual code. In place of homework, we will have weekly quizzes, though
      study assignments will be assigned from the textbook, so to maximize your studying capabilities in this course, I 
      recommend buying the current edition of the required text.</li>
    <li>A scientific calculator, NOT a graphing calculator or any type of programmable calculator, which will NOT be allowed on 
      exams</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to record audio of the lectures to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center><b>Reviews and Review Material</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  There are two more references I would recommend. For math, noting beats 
  <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Math Notes</a>, which provide an excellent review of all necessary math.
  For physics, MIT's Physics II lectures from 1999, given by Walter Lewin, are sort of the gold-standard for online lecture videos
  for physics. YouTube still has the videos uploaded, and a playlist for them can be found
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQSN7X0ro2314mKyUiOILaOC2hk6Pc3j">here</a>. If you need more 
  reference materials, feel free to ask me and I'll be more than happy to recommend additional sources.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>
  
  <br>
    
  During the semester, <b>we will cover the following topics</b> (with the corresponding textbook volume given in parentheses):
    
  <br>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Mathematics review</li>
    <li>Electrostatics (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Electrodynamics/Circuits (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Magnetism (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Geometric Optics (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Introduction to Modern Physics (Vol. 3)</li>
  </ul>
    
  The last segment, Introduction to Modern Physics, depends on time. Ideally, we would be able to cover Relativity (Ch. 36)
  and Cosmology (the last section of Ch. 41), and then some select topics on Quantum Theory (Ch.'s 37, 38, 39, 40, and the
  first sections of Ch. 41). However, as you can probably guess, this is a lot of material, so we probably won't be able 
  to cover all of it.
   
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>
  
  <br>

  For each exam, except for the final, you will have the <b>first 1 hour and 15 minutes of class</b> to take the exam.
  There will be a 5 minute break after the exam. The <b>roughly 50 minutes remaining will be used to cover new material</b>.
  Because the summer semester is short, we have to be economic with our time. 

  <br>
  <br>

  The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response 
  problems, with 10 multiple choice questions worth 2.5 points each (total of 25 points) and 3 free response problems worth 
  25 points each (total of 75 points). <b>There will actually be FOUR available free response problems, of which you only 
  need to answer THREE; you CANNOT do the fourth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to 
  break down like:
    
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Exam 1: Ch.'s 22 - 28</li>
    <li>Exam 2: Ch.'s 29 - 31 and 33 - 34</li>
    <li>Exam 3: Ch.'s 36 - 41 (depending on material covered in Ch.'s 37 - 40) </li>
    <li>Final: All material covered on previous exams.</li>
  </ul>

  <center><b>Grade Calculation:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  <b>You can compute your grade in the class</b> with the following formula (were HW is your grade on the homework, LG is the lowest-graded
  exam, MG is the mid-graded exam, HG is the highest-graded exam, and FE is the final exam):
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center>Grade = (%HW*15) + (%LG*10) + (%MG*20) + (%HG*25) + (%FE*30)</center>
    
  <br>
   
  For example, if you get a 94% on the homework, a 75% on exam 1, a 92% on exam 2, an 85% on exam 3, and an 83% on the final exam,
  your grade in the course will be: (0.94*15) + (0.75*10) + (0.85*20) + (0.92*25) + (0.83*30) = 86.5, which is a B (refer to the 
  grading scale given below). For final grades, <b>I round to the first decimal place</b>; for instance, an 86.92 = 86.9, which 
  is a B, but an 86.96 = 87.0, which is a B+.
