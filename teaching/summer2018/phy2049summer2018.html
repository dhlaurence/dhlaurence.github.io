  <p><center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>
    
  <br>
      
  For this course, you will be <b>required to buy two items</b>: 
    
  <br>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Textbook: <b>Physics for Engineers and Scientists, 3rd ed., Hans C. Ohanian</b> (either Volume 2 and 3, or the full textbook).
      The homework for this class will <b>not be through MasteringPhysics</b>, so you don't need to get a copy of the book 
      that provides the code or buy an individual code; I will be providing homework assignments for you, attached as links 
      to the course calendar below.</li>
    <li>A scientific calculator, NOT a graphing calculator or any type of programmable calculator, which will NOT be allowed on 
      exams</li>
  </ul>
  
  While I <b>strongly</b> recommend buying Volume 3 (if you haven't already bought the entire textbook), as you will see 
  below, this only covers the last section of the course. If you choose not to buy Volume 3, I can <b>try</b> to provide 
  <b>brief</b> notes on the material we cover. <b>This isn't a guarantee. By not buying the textbook, understand that 
  you're taking the risk I might not have time to write the notes. Understand, also, that these notes would be brief, and 
  wouldn't be as inclusive as the textbook.</b>

  <br>

  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to <b>record audio of the lectures</b> to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center><b>Reviews and Review Material</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  There are two more references I would recommend. For math, noting beats 
  <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Math Notes</a>, which provide an excellent review of all necessary math.
  For physics, MIT's Physics I lectures from 1999, given by Walter Lewin, are sort of the gold-standard for online lecture videos
  for physics. YouTube still has the videos uploaded, and a playlist for them can be found
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQSN7X0ro203puVhQsmCj9qhlFQ-As8e">here</a>. If you need more 
  reference materials, feel free to ask me and I'll be more than happy to recommend additional sources.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>
  
  <br>
    
  During the semester, <b>we will cover the following topics</b> (with the corresponding textbook volume given in parentheses):
    
  <br>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Mathematics review</li>
    <li>Electrostatics (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Electrodynamics/Circuits (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Magnetism (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Geometric Optics (Vol. 2)</li>
    <li>Introduction to Modern Physics (Vol. 3)</li>
  </ul>
    
  The last segment, Introduction to Modern Physics, depends on time. Ideally, we would be able to cover Relativity (Ch. 36);
  Quanta of Light (Ch. 37); Spectral Lines, Bohr Theory, and Quantum Mechanics (Ch. 38); Quantum Numbers and the Exclusion 
  Principle (the first 2 sections of Ch. 39); and Nuclei (Ch. 40). However, as you can probably guess, this is a lot of 
  material, so we will aim for the first 3 chapters of the Introduction to Modern Physics and cover any extra material, time 
  allowing.
   
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  Your grade in the course will be based on your performance on the homework assignments, the 3 exams, and the cumulative 
  final exam. See the grading scheme below. The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response 
  problems, with 10 multiple choice questions worth 2.5 points each (total of 25 points) and 3 free response problems worth 
  25 points each (total of 75 points). <b>There will actually be FOUR available free response problems, of which you only 
  need to answer THREE; you CANNOT do the fourth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to 
  break down like:
    
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Exam 1: Ch. 22 - 28</li>
    <li>Exam 2: Ch. 29 - 31 and 33 - 34</li>
    <li>Exam 3: Ch. 36 - 37</li>
    <li>Final: Ch. 22 - 31, 33 - 34, and 36 - 37</li>
  </ul>

  <center><b>Grade Calculation:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  <b>You can compute your grade in the class</b> with the following formula (were HW is your grade on the homework, LG is the lowest-graded
  exam, MG is the mid-graded exam, HG is the highest-graded exam, and FE is the final exam):
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center>Grade = (%HW*15) + (%LG*10) + (%MG*20) + (%HG*25) + (%FE*30)</center>
    
  <br>
   
  For example, if you get a 94% on the homework, a 75% on exam 1, a 92% on exam 2, an 85% on exam 3, and an 83% on the final exam,
  your grade in the course will be: (0.94*15) + (0.75*10) + (0.85*20) + (0.92*25) + (0.83*30) = 86.5, which is a B (refer to the 
  grading scale given below). For final grades, <b>I round to the first decimal place</b>; for instance, an 86.92 = 86.9, which 
  is a B, but an 86.96 = 87.0, which is a B+.
