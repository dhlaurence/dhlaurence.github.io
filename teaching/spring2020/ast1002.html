  <p><center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>

  <br>

  For this course, you will be required to have the following materials:

  <br>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Textbook</b>: <i>Astronomy: A Beginner's Guide to the Universe</i>, 8th edition, by Chaisson & McMillan, ISBN: 9780134243108.</li>
    <li><b>MasteringAstronomy</b>: The homework for this class will be assigned through online software known as MasteringAstronomy.
      You can buy an access code for MasteringAstronomy alone or you can buy it as a package with the textbook from the
      bookstore. Either way, you need a copy of the text and an access code for the homework. Read the "Homework" section
      below for information on MasteringAstronomy.</li>
    <li><b>Scantrons</b>: You will need 2 Scantron sheets for the two exams.</li>
  </ul>

  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to record audio of the lectures to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it.

  <br>
  <br>

  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>

  <br>

  During the semester, <b>we will cover the following topics</b>. Note that these topics are subject to change with
  notification by the professor.

  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>The Copernican Revolution</li>
    <li>Light, Matter, and Telescopes</li>
    <li>The Planets and our Solar System</li>
    <li>Our Sun and other Stars</li>
    <li>Stellar Evolution</li>
    <li>The Milky Way and other Galaxies</li>
    <li>Cosmology</li>
  </ul>


  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>

  <br>

  The exams will be multiple choice, containing about 30 problems each. For each exam, you will need a Scantron sheet to fill
  in your answers; this means you need a total of 2 Scantron sheets for the class. The material covered on each exam is
  (tentatively) shown in the course schedule below. Note that exam 2 is <b>not cumulative</b>; it only covers the material since
  exam 1.

  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Make-up exams will not be offered in this course</b>. Instead, if you have a legitimate emergency and cannot make it to
  the exam, I will replace your missed exam with the average of your other two exams. If you know ahead of time that you will
  have to miss an exam, please let me know <b>in advance</b>. Legitimate
  reasons to miss an exam are outlined in the Student Handbook for Broward College; any other reason is up to the discretion
  of the professor.

  <br>
  <br>

  <center><b>Homework:</b></center>

  <br>

  Homework will be assigned through MasteringAstronomy (<b>course code</b> laurence48312), with roughly one assignment due each week, though it depends on how
  long a particular topic takes us to cover in class; you will be able to see the homework schedule through the
  MasteringAstronomy website. To access MasteringAstronomy, you must go to the following website:
  <a target="_blank" href="http://pearsonmylabandmastering.com">http://pearsonmylabandmastering.com</a>. This website,
  speficically, offers a 2 week free trial for MasteringAstronomy in case you need time to purchase your access code.

  <br>
  <br>

  While each homework assignment will vary in the number of questions asked, each assignment will be worth the same number
  of points, i.e. each homework assignment will be equally weighted. Some homework assignments which have a lot of subject
  matter to cover will have extra credit questions assigned. Each homework assignment will also be available for you to
  turn in late up to one-week after the due date, so even if you're running a bit late, make sure to turn it in! If, for
  any legitimate reason, you absolutely need an extension for your homework, please let me know <b>before</b> the due date
  of the homework, and I'll be happy to provide you a reasonable extension.</p>
