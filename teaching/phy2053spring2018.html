  <h3>Section #: 584771 <br> Class Time: TR 12:30PM - 1:45PM <br> Room: <b>TBA</b></h3>
  <p>(Official) Office Hours: 
    <br><br>M : 11A - 12P
    <br>T : 1130A - 1230P and 330P - 430P
    <br>W : 11A - 12P and 4P - 5P
    <br>R : 2P - 4P
    <br><br><i>If I'm in my office, feel free to ask me questions, whether or not it's during the "official" office hours.</i>

  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p><center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>
    
  <br>
      
  For this course, you will be <b>required to buy two items</b>: 
    
  <br>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Textbook: <b>Physics, 5th ed., James S. Walker, ISBN: 9780321976444</b> The homework for
      this class will <b>not be through MasteringPhysics</b>, so you don't need to get a copy of the book that provides the
      code or buy an individual code; I will be providing homework assignments for you, attached as links to the course 
      calendar below.</li>
    <li>A scientific calculator, NOT a graphing calculator or any type of programmable calculator, which will NOT be allowed on 
      exams</li>
  </ul>
    
  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to <b>record audio of the lectures</b> to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center><b>Reviews and Review Material</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  For a great review of all the mathematics necessary for physics, I don't think you can beat
  <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Math Notes</a>. It has thorough reviews of algebra, trigonometry, 
  pre-calculus, etc., all of which are essential to suceeding in a physics course. The number 1 issue that students have in learning 
  physics, from what I've seen, is a lack of comfort with algebra; so the best thing you can do to ease the learning process is to
  make sure your math skills are honed and up-to-date.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>
  
  <br>
    
  We will meet for lecture twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays from noon to 1:50PM. If you've never taken a physics class before, you should read my note on how to succeed in a physics class
  <a href="http://www.blazartheory.com/other/underconstruction.html">here</a>. During the semester, <b>we will cover the 
  following topics</b>:
    
  <br>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Vectors</li>
    <li>Kinematics</li>
    <li>Newton's Laws</li>
    <li>Energy Conservation</li>
    <li>Momentum Conservation</li>
    <li>Rotational Motion and Gravity</li>
    <li>Applications: Simple harmonic motion, waves, and fluids</li>
    <li>Thermodynamics</li>
  </ul>
    
  If you have a question that you need answered, but don't have tine to meet me in my office during office hours, email me at 
  <b>TBA</b>; make sure you <b>include the class you're in with the section number</b>, e.g. PHY2053 584771, so that I know 
  what class you're in. I'm teaching seven courses this semester, so I might not be able to remember which class you're in off
  the top of my head.
   
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  Your grade in the course will be based on your performance on the homework assignments, the 3 exams, and the cumulative final
  exam. See the grading scheme below. The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response problems, with 10
  multiple choice questions worth 2 points each (total of 20 points) and 4 free response problems worth 20 points each (total of 80
  points). <b>There will actually be FIVE available free response problems, of which you only need to answer FOUR; you CANNOT do
  the fifth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to break down like:
    
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Exam 1: </li>
    <li>Exam 2: </li>
    <li>Exam 3: </li>
    <li>Final: </li>
  </ul>
    
  <!--Even though you won't be tested on it directly, you <b>should read chapter 1</b>, as an introduction to the study of physics. We're
  going to approach the material in a way slightly out of order with respect to the textbook. For instance, we're going to begin
  with a mathematics review, which includes chapter 3 (and other math not reviewed in the textbook), so that's where we'll begin;
  chapter 9, gravitation, is best studied <b>after</b> we cover rotational motion, so we'll discuss it after we finish chapter
  13, which is why it appears on exam 3 and not exam 2. As a final comment, we won't be covering thermodynamics -- chapters 19, 20,
  and 21 -- on any of the exams, but they <b>will</b> be on the cumulative final exam. For a detailed itinerary of the semester, see
  the Course Schedule below.
    
  <br>
  <br>-->
  
  <center><b>Grade Calculation:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  <b>You can compute your grade in the class</b> with the following formula (were HW is your grade on the homework, LG is the lowest-graded
  exam, MG is the mid-graded exam, HG is the highest-graded exam, and FE is the final exam):
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center>Grade = (%HW*15) + (%LG*10) + (%MG*20) + (%HG*25) + (%FE*30)</center>
    
  <br>
   
  For example, if you get a 94% on the homework, a 75% on exam 1, a 92% on exam 2, an 85% on exam 3, and an 83% on the final exam,
  your grade in the course will be: (0.94*15) + (0.75*10) + (0.85*20) + (0.92*25) + (0.83*30) = 86.5, which is a B (refer to the 
  grading scale given below). For final grades, <b>I round to the first decimal place</b>; for instance, an 86.92 = 86.9, which 
  is a B, but an 86.96 = 87.0, which is a B+.
