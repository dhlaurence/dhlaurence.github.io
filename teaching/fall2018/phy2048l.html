  <br>
  
  For this course, you will not need to purchase anything. The lab manual is provided 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://browardcentralscience.org/physics/manualstexts/PHY2048L%20Lab%20Manual%20(Aug2009).pdf">here</a>. 
  You <b>will not</b> need to purchase a lab coat or goggles for this lab, as we won't be dealing with any dangerous chemicals.

  <center><b>Lab Schedule</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  The lab schedule is provided 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://browardcentralscience.org/schedules/Phys%20I/LAB%20SCHEDULES%20Term%20I%20Session%201%202019%20PHY2048L.pdf">here</a>. 
  Each entry in the schedule corresponds to a particular experiment in the lab manual, except for the first week, which is a 
  short meeting to sign the safety waivers for the lab.

  <center><b>Grading</b></center>
    
  <br>
  
  Grading is based on two components: 50% of your grade will be determined by participation (i.e. attendence) and 50% of your 
  grade will be determined by your lab reports, with the lowest lab dropped. This means that you can miss one lab and not have 
  it count against your final grade. Each lab report is included at the end of each experiment; all you have to do 
  is fill in your data and your calculations. As long as you follow instructions and ask questions when you're stuck, I'll 
  make sure you're doing the labs correctly.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The grading scheme for the lab is as follows:
    
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><table style="width:40%">
  <tr>
    <th>Letter Grade</th>
    <th>Points Earned</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>90.0 - 100.0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>80.0 - 89.9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>70.0 - 79.9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>60.0 - 69.9</td>
