  <p><center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>
    
  <br>
      
  For this course, you will be required to have the following materials: 
    
  <br>
    
  <ul>
    <li><b>Textbook</b>: <i>University Physics</i>, 14th edition, by Young and Freedman. This book can either be bought
      by volume (<b>volume 1</b> is required for this course) or as a complete text with all 3 volumes.
      <font color="red">The textbook was recently changed and the bookstore might <b>not</b> have updated their systems
        yet. If you bought the previously assigned textbook (Physics for Engineers and Scientists by Ohanian), please
        return it to the bookstore as soon as possible.</font></li>
    <li><b>MasteringPhysics</b>: The homework for this class will be assigned through online software known as MasteringPhysics.
      You can buy an access code for MasteringPhysics alone or you can buy it as a package with the textbook from the 
      bookstore. Either way, you need a cope of the text and an access code for the homework. Read the "Homework" section
      below for information on MasteringPhysics.
    <li><b>Other Materials</b>: A scientific calculator, <b>not</b> a graphing calculator or other type of programmable 
      calculator, which will <b>not</b> be allowed on exams</li>
  </ul>

  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to record audio of the lectures to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center><b>Reviews and Review Material</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  There are two more references I would recommend. For math, noting beats 
  <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Math Notes</a>, which provide an excellent review of all necessary math.
  For physics, MIT's Physics II lectures from 1999, given by Walter Lewin, are sort of the gold-standard for online lecture videos
  for physics. YouTube still has the videos uploaded, and a playlist for them can be found
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQSN7X0ro203puVhQsmCj9qhlFQ-As8e">here</a>. If you need more 
  reference materials, feel free to ask me and I'll be more than happy to recommend additional sources.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>
  
  <br>
    
  During the semester, <b>we will cover the following topics</b>. Note that these topics are subject to change with 
  notification by the professor.
    
  <br>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Mathematics review</li>
    <li>Motion and Kinematics</li>
    <li>Forces and Newtonian Mechanics</li>
    <li>Energy and Energy Physics</li>
    <li>Momentum and Collisions</li>
    <li>Rotational Mechanics</li>
    <li>Gravity</li>
    <li>Oscillations and Waves</li>
    <li>Thermodynamics</li>
  </ul>
    
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>
  
  <br>

  The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response problems. There will be 10 multiple choice 
  questions worth 2.5 points each (total of 25 points) and 3 free response problems worth 
  25 points each (total of 75 points). <b>There will actually be FOUR available free response problems, of which you only 
  need to answer THREE; you CANNOT do the fourth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to 
  break down like:
    
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Exam 1: TBA</li>
    <li>Exam 2: TBA</li>
    <li>Exam 3: TBA</li>
    <li>Final: All material covered on previous exams</li>
  </ul>
  
  <b>Make-up exams will not be offered in this course</b>. Instead, if you have a legitimate emergency and cannot make it to
  the exam, I will give you the option of replacing your score with <b>either</b> the average of your other two exams 
  (there are three exams and a final in the course) <b>or</b> your grade on the final exam. However, the choice must be made
  at the time you will be missing the exam; you can't simply wait until the end of the course and choose the better of the
  two options. If you know ahead of time that you will have to miss an exam, please let me know <b>in advance</b>. Legitimate
  reasons to miss an exam are outlined in the Student Handbook for Broward College; any other reason is up to the discretion
  of the professor.
  
  <center><b>Homework:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  Homework will be assigned through MasteringPhysics, with roughly one assignment due each week, though it depends on how
  long a particular topic takes us to cover in class; you will be able to see the homework schedule through the 
  MasteringPhysics website. To access MasteringPhysics, you must go to the following website:
  <a target="_blank" href="http://pearsonmylabandmastering.com">http://pearsonmylabandmastering.com</a>. This website, 
  speficically, offers a 2 week free trial for MasteringPhysics in case you need time to purchase your access code. I will
  discuss how to register for this 2 week free trial on the first day of class. 
  
  <br>
  
  While each homework assignment will vary in the number of questions asked, each assignment will be worth the same number
  of points, i.e. each homework assignment will be equally weighted. Some homework assignments which have a lot of subject
  matter to cover will have extra credit questions assigned. Each homework assignment will also be available for you to
  turn in late up to one-week after the due date, so even if you're running a bit late, make sure to turn it in! If, for 
  any legitimate reason, you absolutely need an extension for your homework, please let me know <b>before</b>the due date
  of the homework, and I'll be happy to provide you a reasonable extension.</p>
