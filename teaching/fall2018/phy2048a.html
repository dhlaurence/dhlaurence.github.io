  <p><center><b>Course Materials:</b></center>
    
  <br>
      
  For this course, you will be required to have the following materials: 
    
  <br>
    
  <ul>
    <li><b>Textbook</b>: <i>University Physics</i>, 14th edition, by Young and Freedman. This book can either be bought
      by volume (<b>volume 1</b> is required for this course) or as a complete text with all 3 volumes.
      <font color="red">The textbook was recently changed and the bookstore might <b>not</b> have updated their systems
        yet. If you bought the previously assigned textbook (Physics for Engineers and Scientists by Ohanian), please
        return it to the bookstore as soon as possible.</font></li>
    <li><b>MasteringPhysics</b>: The homework for this class will be assigned through online software known as MasteringPhysics.
      You can buy an access code for MasteringPhysics alone or you can buy it as a package with the textbook from the 
      bookstore. Either way, you need a cope of the text and an access code for the homework.
    <li><b>Other Materials</b>: A scientific calculator, <b>not</b> a graphing calculator or other type of programmable 
      calculator, which will <b>not</b> be allowed on exams</li>
  </ul>

  Further, you are expected to have a notebook (or paper of any form), a writing utensil, etc., so that you can properly take
  notes during the class. Feel free to record audio of the lectures to playback later; whatever helps you learn, I'm on
  board with it. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
  <center><b>Reviews and Review Material</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  There are two more references I would recommend. For math, noting beats 
  <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Math Notes</a>, which provide an excellent review of all necessary math.
  For physics, MIT's Physics II lectures from 1999, given by Walter Lewin, are sort of the gold-standard for online lecture videos
  for physics. YouTube still has the videos uploaded, and a playlist for them can be found
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQSN7X0ro2314mKyUiOILaOC2hk6Pc3j">here</a>. If you need more 
  reference materials, feel free to ask me and I'll be more than happy to recommend additional sources.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Course Topics:</b></center>
  
  <br>
    
  During the semester, <b>we will cover the following topics</b>:
    
  <br>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Mathematics review</li>
    <li>Electrostatics</li>
    <li>Electrodynamics/Circuits</li>
    <li>Magnetism</li>
    <li>Geometric Optics</li>
    <li>Introduction to Modern Physics</li>
  </ul>
    
  The last segment of material, Introduction to Modern Physics, depends on time. Essentially, there are two broad topics 
  that we can break modern physics into:
  
  <br>
  
  <ul>
    <li><b>Relativity</b>: Special relativity (Ch. 36) and Cosmology (last section of Ch. 41). Relativity is Einstein's 
      study of objects that are either moving very fast (special relativity) or are very massive (general relativity).</li>
    <li><b>Quantum Mechanics</b>: Quanta of light (Ch. 37); Spectral lines, Bohr theory, & quantum mechanics (Ch. 38); 
      Atoms, molecules, & solids (Ch. 39); Nuclei (Ch. 40); and Elementary particles (first sections of Ch. 41). Quantum 
      mechanics is the study of the really small, like particles, nuclei, and atoms.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Ideally, we would be able to cover Relativity and then Quantum Mechanics. However, as you can probably guess, this is a 
  lot of material, so we will more-than-likely only have enough time for one of these subjects; which one we cover will be 
  decided upon by a vote in class.
   
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <center><b>Exams:</b></center>
  
  <br>

  For each exam, except for the final, you will have the <b>first 1 hour and 15 minutes of class</b> to take the exam.
  There will be a 5 minute break after the exam. The <b>roughly 50 minutes remaining will be used to cover new material</b>.
  Because the summer semester is short, we have to be economic with our time. 

  <br>
  <br>

  The exams will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free response 
  problems, with 10 multiple choice questions worth 2.5 points each (total of 25 points) and 3 free response problems worth 
  25 points each (total of 75 points). <b>There will actually be FOUR available free response problems, of which you only 
  need to answer THREE; you CANNOT do the fourth problem for extra credit</b>. The material covered on each exam is going to 
  break down like:
    
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Exam 1: Chapters 22 - 28</li>
    <li>Exam 2: Chapters 29 - 31 and 33 - 34</li>
    <li>Exam 3: Modern Physics (Chapters <b>TBD</b>) </li>
    <li>Final: All material covered on previous exams</li>
  </ul>
  
  <center><b>Quizzes:</b></center>
  
  <br>
  
  At the start of every week, on a Monday unless otherwise stated, we will have a short quiz at the <b>end of the first 
  class</b>. This quiz will have two questions: one conceptual, multiple-choice question, and one problem involving 
  computation, which may or may not be multiple-choice. <b>Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped</b> in the calculation 
  of your final grade.
