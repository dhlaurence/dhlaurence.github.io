    Important Announcement: </font></b>
    <br> 
    The textbook for the course has changed! The textbook that will be used is:
    <ul>
      <li>University Physics, 14th edition, by Young and Freedman (either volume 1 or the full text).</li>
    </ul>
    Make sure to get a <b>MasteringPhysics code</b> with the textbook. Hopefully within the next few days (as of August 8),
    the bookstore will offer the textbook and the MasteringPhysics code as a package. Make sure to check the bookstore's
    website regularly if you wish to buy the package; otherwise, the textbook and the MasteringPhysics code can be bought
    separately.
