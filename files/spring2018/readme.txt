This folder is for files associated with the classes I taught in the Spring 2018 semester at Broward College. That semester, I taught seven classes: a section of PHY2048, three sections of PHY2048L, a section of PHY2053, a section of PHY2053L, and a section of AST1002. There are a lot of notes for thoses classes, and I'm putting the notes folder through some serious organization because it desperately needs it.
