    You've reached the website of Douglas H. Laurence. This website doubles as an interactive CV and a portal for 
    students to access information about their classes. In addition, I have collected many, many notes on random topics in
    physics over the years, and have been in the process of typesetting them in LaTex. I will be posting these notes as I 
    finish typesetting them in the "Notes" page, so if you're interested, check them out. As my main interests in physics 
    have always lay in fundamental physics, the notes are going to center around mathematics, quantum field theory, and 
    general relativity, with many additional notes on classical mechanics simply because it's one of my favorite subjects.

    My research is conducted as part of the FIU Blazar Group, under the guidance of Dr. James R. Webb. You can find the 
    webpage for the FIU Blazar Group at <a target="_blank" href="http://faculty.fiu.edu/~webbj/micro_web.html">here</a>.
