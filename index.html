    This is a test of github pages. Now I'm going to edit this page, because it shouldn't reflect any changes until I merge it with the other brance, gh-pages. What I don't understand is that this html file is being edited in the master branch. According to the settings, the master branch is what's being published. But it's not until I merge with the other branch that things work.
    
    Now time to link stuff.
