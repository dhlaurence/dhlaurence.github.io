  <p>You've reached the personal website of Douglas H. Laurence (obviously). My website includes background information on myself, a page
    for the courses I'm teaching, a collection of notes on random physics topics that I've accumulated over the years, 
    a page about my current research projects and research interests in general, and a link (click "Publications" on the navigation bar)
    to my INSPIRE-HEP account, which has all of my current publications. Check out the different pages, particularly the page 
    on my research and the page with my notes, if you're a physics student, or just interested in physics.
