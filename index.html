  <p>You've reached the personal website of Douglas H. Laurence (obviously). My website includes background information on myself,
    a page about my current research projects and research interests in general, a page for the courses I'm teaching, links
    to my publications, and a collection of notes on random physics topics that I've accumulated over the years. Check out
    the different pages, particularly the page on my research and the page with my notes, if you're a physics student.
