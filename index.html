    You've reached the website of Douglas H. Laurence. This website doubles as an interactive CV and a portal for
    students to access information about their classes. In addition, I have collected many notes on random topics in
    physics over the years, and have been in the process of typesetting them in LaTex. I will be posting these notes as I
    finish them in the "Notes" page; check them out if you're interested. As my main interests in physics
    have always lay in fundamental physics, you'll find nmany notes concerning mathematics, quantum field theory, and
    general relativity. Additional notes concerning a wide variety of topics are also included. I am still working to
    continue posting additional notes to the site.

    My research focuses on theoretical aspects of blazars, mostly concerning the supermassive, rapidly rotating black holes
    at their centers and the luminous plasma jets they emit. The brightnes and color spectra of these jets can change over time,
    with large magnitude changes occuring over long periods of time caused by changes to the internal environments of the jet and
    the black hole itself. However, over the last couple of decades, small magnitude changres occuring over extremely short time
    intervals -- these so-called micro-variations -- were discovered and have been the subject of much interest. Currently, I am
    working on a theoretical model to explain this micro-variability in the synchrotron emission of these blazar jets. You can read
    about my work, and the work of my research group, by clicking on the "Research" tab above. My research is conducted as part of
    the FIU Blazar Group, under the guidance of Dr. James R. Webb of Florida International University. You can find the webpage
    for the FIU Blazar Group at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://faculty.fiu.edu/~webbj/micro_web.html">here</a>, as well as my INSPIRE-HEP page with
    my most recent papers by clicking on the "Publications" tab at the top.
