    You've reached the personal website of Douglas H. Laurence. This website doubles as an interactive CV and a portal for 
    students to access information about their classes. In addition, I have collected many, many notes on random topics in
    physics over the years, and have been in the process of typesetting them in LaTex. I will be posted these notes as I 
    finish typesetting them in the "Notes" page, so if you're interested, check them out.

    My research is conducted as part of the FIU Blazar Group, under the guidance of Dr. James R. Webb. You can find the 
    webpage for the FIU Blazar Group at <a target="_blank" href="http://faculty.fiu.edu/~webbj/micro_web.html">here</a>.
