  <h3>Brief Bio:</h3>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Miami, FL. I started college in 2006 at Miami-Dade College, transferring to Florida International
    University (FIU) in 2008 with an AA. I finished my BS in Physics with a minor in Chemistry at FIU in 2011. Since 2011, 
    I have been a doctoral student in Physics at FIU, specializing in theoretical astrophysics. Recently, FIU instituted a 
    policy that allowed doctoral candidates (those who had finished their classes and proposed their dissertations) to 
    automatically receive a non-thesis M.S. degree, so when I received mine, I searched for adjunct faculty positions to build
    teaching experience while I finish my Ph.D. My first teaching position was as an adjunct professor at Nova Southeastern University,
    in Davie, FL. Since Spring 2018, I have been an Assistant Professor of Physics at Broward College, also in Davie, FL.

    During my first two years of graduate school, I worked under Dr. R. Narayanan, conducting research in quantum field theory
    (specifically lattice quantum chromodynamics, working on large N, 2- and 3-dimensional field theories). After those years, 
    I switched tracks and have been working under Dr. James R. Webb since. As I said, my current research is in theoretical 
    astrophysics. Specifically, I study small-amplitude, short-duration variations in the synchrotron emission of blazars, a 
    phenomenon referred to as "micro-variability". This research is really interesting for many reasons, but it mainly gives us 
    a chance to peer into the inner workings of these very active galaxies and investigate the rapidly rotating, supermassive 
    black holes at their cores. For a more in-depth overview of my current research, click on the "Research" tab above. You 
    can also click on the "Publications" tab above to be taken to my INSPIRE-HEP profile.

    In 2016, I published a high school physics textbook for the Princeton Review, <i>High School Physics Unlocked</i>. Copies
    are available on 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/High-School-Physics-Unlocked-Understanding/dp/1101921536/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1500363463&sr=8-5&keywords=high+school+unlocked" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>,
    and a preview of the book can be found through 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f42xCwAAQBAJ">Google Books</a>.
