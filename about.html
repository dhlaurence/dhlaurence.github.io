    <h3>Brief Bio:</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Miami, FL. I started college in 2006 at Miami-Dade College, moving onto Florida International University in 2008 and finishing my BS in Physics there in 2011. Since 2011, I have been working on my PhD in Physics at FIU, specializing in theoretical astrophysics. I received my MS in Physics along the way, and I expect to finish my doctoral degree by the end of the current year (2017).</p>
      
    <p>During my first two years of graduate school, I worked under Dr. R. Narayanan, conducting research in quantum field theory (specifically lattice field theory). After those years, I switched tracks and have been working under Dr. James R. Webb since. As I said, my current research is in theoretical astrophysics. Specifically, I study small-amplitude, short-duration variations in the synchrotron emission of blazars. This research is really interesting for many reasons, but it mainly gives us a chance to peer into the inner workings of these very active galaxies and investigate the rapidly rotating, supermassive black holes at their cores. For a more in-depth overview of my research, go to the research page.</p>
      
    <p>In 2016, I published a high school physics textbook for the Princeton Review, <i>High School Physics Unlocked</i>. Copies are available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-School-Physics-Unlocked-Understanding/dp/1101921536/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1500363463&sr=8-5&keywords=high+school+unlocked">Amazon.com</a>, and a preview of the book can be found through <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f42xCwAAQBAJ">Google Books</a>.
