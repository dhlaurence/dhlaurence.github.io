    I am currently in the process of writing my own textbook -- really more of a series of lecture notes -- for introductory physics
    with calculus, to replace the assigned textbook for Broward College used in my classes. This is not because I have anything 
    against the assigned textbook, but because it's more efficient for the students to see the material exactly as I want them to see it,
    in exactly the order that I want them to see it. Plus, this textbook is free!

    Currently, the textbook is being written. Check back here for updates, as I will be routinely releasing new chapters.

    <b>Current version:</b> In initial stages of being written; nothing yet released. The first few chapters will be released soon!
