  <p>
    I am currently in the process of writing my own textbook for my classes on introductory physics with calculus at Broward
    College, to replace the assigned textbook currently being used in PHY2048/PHY2049. This is not because I have anything
    against the assigned textbook, but because it's more efficient for the students to see the material exactly as I want them to see it,
    in exactly the order that I want them to see it. Plus, this textbook is free! Currently, the book is in the initial stages of
    being written, and no draft has been posted yet. Check back here for updates, as I will try to release new chapters as the
    semester goes on.
  </p>

  <h3>Current version</h3>
  <p>Currently, the book is still in the initial stages of development. Once the first 2-3 chapters are written, then I will post
    the first draft of the textbook. Check back soon, and be sure to check in regularly! The table below keeps tracm=k of the
    status of the book, so you can know instantly whether or not the book has been udpated since you checked last.</p>

  <h3>Errata</h3>
  <p>Think you found a mistake in the text? Errata for the textbook hasn't been established yet, but you can find the page dedicated
    to errata <a href="/uptextbook/errata.html">here</a>. If the mistake you've found isn't listed in
    the errata, send me an email at <a href="mailto:comments@blazartheory.com" target="_top">comments@blazartheory.com</a>
