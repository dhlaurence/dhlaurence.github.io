    During my first two years of graduate school, I worked very hard to learn the foundations of quantum mechanics as best I could, 
    since my research was in quantum field theory (lattice quantum chromodynamics, specifically). Part of this involved typing up 
    many a random set of notes on this topic or that topic. Eventually, around my third year of graduate school, the undergraduate 
    members of the physics club at my university asked for me to give a series of lectures on undergraduate-level quantum mechanics, 
    to supplement their class. After a while, I had typed up the majority of a textbook, essentially. This page represents my efforts 
    to finish the set of lecture notes, which would cover all the material presented in a one-year, undergraduate quantum mechanics 
    course, presented in a fairly rigorous manner, mathematically speaking.
